Last weekend was Maker Faire in Kansas City and I exhibited my home automation project running on Raspberry Pis. A fair number of people were interested in the project and asked me for details on the build and the parts involved. I told them I'd have the first set of details up this weekend. A couple people have emailed me about the project and how my site was down. I wouldn't call it down so much as never created: )

I updated the DNS entries this morning and got Github Pages working today. For anyone interested in the project, please check back on Sunday as I'll have some project related things posted by then. Sorry for the delay and thanks for the patience!
