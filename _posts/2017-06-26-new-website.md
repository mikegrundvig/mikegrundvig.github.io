Many years ago I used to keep a blog about programming and game development in Flash. It was rarely updated but I still put a few things out there that I thought were of interest. I've been meaning to get back to it eventually but never really had the time. Now that I have a bit more time I figure I'll give it another shot. 

This time around I don't plan on focusing on game development so much as just general projects and topics I find interesting. We'll see if I can't be a bit more consistent this time around.
